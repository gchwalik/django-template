# django template 

This template is intended to server for personal projects as well as future interviews which ask for an example server. 

## commands



## TODOS
- get base server running (building off django tutorial since it's been a bit since i've written from scratch)
- implement various plug-in functionality: send a text, send an email (should consume an api)
- wrap in docker 
- wrap in k8s 
- get pipeline set up in github using travis 
- add prometheus monitoring 
- mess with grafana, loki, promtail
